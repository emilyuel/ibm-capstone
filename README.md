IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project Files for Module 9. 

My work is divided into 3 ipynb files to avoid lag with all the charts and tables created. This includes the majority of my work 
used for my capstone presentation (see DataAnalystPresenation.pdf). Date of completion was 8-jul-2025. Truly had a great time
brushing up on my python skills and hopefully I have the opportunity to keep using them!
